1.) Is the game to easy or hard? Give 3 reasons why it is easy or hard.

	a. Too hard: Phasing makes you miss the power ups
	b. Too easy: The learning curve is too easy, after playing for a short time you get used to the speed and it doesn't require a lot of effort
	c. Too easy: Only has one obstacle that has to be avoided

2.) What 3 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

	a. Change the code so that when the player is phased out they can still pick up power ups
	b. Make the obstacles, powerups, and the player move faster over time so that the longer you play, the faster everything gets
	c. Add an obstacle that is similar looking to the powerup but does not have particle effects, hitting this will also slow the player's speed

3.) List three things that would give it a "wow" factor.

	a. Changing the materials that are applied to the environment
	b. Adding sound effects and music
	c. Making it more difficult by adding more obstacle types so that it is more engaging to play

4.) What parts of the game are fun? 3 items

	a. Narrowly dodging obstacles and barely making it on time to grab a power up
	b. Looking at the visual effects on the powerups and obstacles
	c. Using the phase ability to dodge obstacles

5.) What parts of the game are tedious? 3 items

	a. The movement is a little too slippery, would benefit from having tighter controls
	b. It's too easy to play and makes it boring after getting used to the speed
	c. The phase ability makes you miss power ups. Makes you not want to use it
